    . Sec+ Cysa+ Pentest+ EJPT certifications to check out
    . Also start learning about what your interested in, read blogs, articles, what videos, listen to podcasts, just start learning about it
    . SANS Institute is the most trusted resource for cybersecurity training, certifications and research. Offering more than 60 courses across all practice areas
    . SANS has BA's now as well that you can get the gi bill to pay. IMHO there training is top notch

    . I did the traditional route... A+ce, Security+ce, and then moved into a specialty like CHFI. I then started getting into Offensive ops and moved away from "after" the incident occurs - to causing the incident to occur. Really depends. I think starting with the HOST and moving out towards the greater network and apps is good.  Then again -Learning Linux, networking, and a cloud based cert is always good right now - since everyone is moving into the cloud. The 4 you have up there... are just fine... I would replace #4 with a Cloud based cert.... like AWS Security Specialty. CCNA, Linux, and Python are all good to have on your resume... remember - ALL IT professionals started somewhere - plan your attack on where you see yourself for the next 5 yrs... things change, but make sure your certs will allow it & you can stay dynamic in an ever changing environment!

    . If you're not in IT but you're considering a career in cybersecurity, whether it's because you're caught up in the buzz or genuinely interested, here's a tip: start your journey in roles like system administration, IT support, helpdesk, or anything else involving networks and servers. This is something really overlooked in the marketing/HR whatever cybersecurity hype business.  So, that's just my personal piece of advice. It's a fantastic field, and you're bound to learn heaps regardless of the path you choose. But don't get too dazzled by the glamour. Be patient, start from the basics, and work your way up. It's worth it, trust me.

    Dicas para arrumar trampo em sec
    Fazer linkedin
    Seguir algumas empresas e observar as vagas de sec
    (Exemplos: bancos(itau, nubank, santander, c6, btg, xp, inter…),
    tech(google, ibm, microsoft, meta, amazon, netflix, spotify…),
    outros(mercado livre, magalu, ambev, ifood, serasa experian, cielo, pagbank, creditas, picpay, quinto andar, loft, idwall…)
    Se candidatar para vagas de estágio, junior, e trainee)
    Pegar “experiência” em fazer entrevistas, ver o que funciona e o que não funciona pra passar nas entrevistas.
    Por exemplo, demonstrar que está disposto a aprender coisas novas e se adapta com facilidade geralmente é uma boa.
    Perguntar sobre as características da vaga e da empresa também gostam.
    Demonstrar que você pesquisou sobre a empresa, demonstrar que você é uma pessoa comunicativa, que vai se dar bem com as pessoas, que vai aprender, ensinar e compartilhar conhecimentos…
    Só exemplos, mas tem muitas nuances que tu só pega fazendo muitas entrevistas e falhando em várias e passando em algumas.

    I would go THM premium for idk 2 or 3 months and do the paths, it's a great way to start.
    Then check out INE free paths and maybe their certs if you dig this stuff. Then go to HTB for more challenging stuff.
    I would avoid focusing on something like the Cisco courses since it's really basic and it mostly just covers concepts and theory,
    not many practical stuff and they focus on Cisco stuff (which is not so relevant at first).

    CompTIA Security+ course by Jason Dion on Udemy. This is really good to get the basis knowledge and concepts of cybersecurity.

    PEN-200 – Penetration Testing with Kali Linux by Offensive Security. This is probably the best course for pentesting and you’ll learn everything you need for the OSCP exam. OSCP is the most sought certification in the IT field so it’s worth it.

    CompTIA Security+ course by Professor Messer on YouTube. Very good content and it’s 100% free.

    My advice is to invest in LinkedIn. Watch a YouTube videos on how to professionalize your LinkedIn profile or even, on LinkedIn https://www.linkedin.com/learning/rock-your-linkedin-profile?trk=share_android_course_learning&shareId=cns4fuA9SzCUimjkms1Thw%3D%3D . Then subscribe to LinkedIn premium. The reason I like LinkedIn learning is, whenever you complete a course you can post the certificate of completion on your profile. Recruiters and interviewers will always checkout your LinkedIn profile. There they will see that you are improving in your knowledge. Link up with people in the same profession as you also and let them know you are in the job market. These days i only use LinkedIn Jobs to apply for positions because it helps me keep track of where i have applied. I had applied for one position on two different platforms and i was disqualified. So that's my two cents to your question. Good luck as you look. Don't forget 20+ application a day is not much.
